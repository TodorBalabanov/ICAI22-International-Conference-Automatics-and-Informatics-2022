\begin{abstract}
Genetic algorithms are very well-known optimization meta-heuristics. They are very well presented in mathematical applications like Matlab, R, and others. Such specific implementations are not proper for industrial software development. Because of its popularity, genetic algorithms have become implemented as third-party software libraries. The popularity of Android OS with its capabilities for running Java source code attracted the usage of external software libraries for achieving mobile distributed computing tasks. Training of artificial neural networks and curve fitting by the usage of genetic algorithms brought financial time series forecasting to the mobile world. In this study, two of the most popular genetic algorithm software libraries are compared in order to be used in mobile distributed computing application.

\section{Introduction}

In the face of mobile distributed computing \cite{Bibi-2021-a}, state of the art in soft computing \cite{Angelova-2009-a} received a valuable extension. Additional acceleration of mobile device usage adoption has been given by Covid-19 pandemic \cite{Petrov-2021-a}. Wireless sensor networks \cite{Alexandrov-2016-a} in combination with smart routing \cite{Tashev-2019-a} and IoT \cite{Dineva-2019-a} were a valuable idea source for mobile distributed computing implementations. The usage of heterogeneous devices \cite{Weinbub-2012-a}  appears to be very efficient for slipping calculations in complex combinatorial problems \cite{Borissova-2015-a}. When calculating devices are in a volunteer scheme the control over them is unknown \cite{Balabanov-2020-a}, which leads to a number of cybersecurity issues \cite{Dimitrov-2021-a}. 

In this study, a mobile distributed computing software \cite{Balabanov-2022-a} has been extended. The extension comes to the machine learning algorithms applied in financial time series forecasting. Two of the most popular software libraries for genetic algorithms are included (MOEA Framework \cite{Huo-2018-a} and Jenetics \cite{Aalam-2022-a}). 

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces mobile distributed computing and its specifics; Section 2 presents financial time series forecasting and some of the related challenges; Section 3 reveals some experiments and results; Section 4 concludes and provides some guidance for further research.

\section{Mobile Distributed Computing}

Only a limited number of computational problems are proper for distributed computing. The main condition for this suitability is the presence of calculating instructions that can be performed simultaneously \cite{Hillis-1986-a}. When it comes to computers in a global network, it is useful for the synchronization of the results to be done less frequently than in parallel computing. For example, the parallel implementation of the QuickSort \cite{Sanders-1997-a} algorithm is not proper as distributed computing implementation.
